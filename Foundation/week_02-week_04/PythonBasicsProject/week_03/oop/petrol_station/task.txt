# Petrol Station

- Create `Station` and `Car` classes
- `Station`
  - it stores how much gas is avaliable: `gas_amount`
  - it can refill a car: `refill(car)`:
    - decreases the gas_amount by the capacity of the car
      (let us suppose that the car is empty) and
    - increases the car's gas_amount
- `Car`
  - it stores how much gas is actually present: `gas_amount`
  - it stores the capacity of the tank: `capacity`
  - create a constructor for the `Car` class where you:
    - initialize gasAmount -> 0
    - initialize capacity -> 100
